BTMux Template IO
=================

This module is used to parse BattletechMUX (BTMux) template files. In the future,
this could be expanded to having write support for template files.

If you don't know what any of this means, this module probably won't be of
any use or interest to you. It's very niche, and I keep it here mostly for
my own tracking.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7 (but not Python 3)
